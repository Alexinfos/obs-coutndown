# OBS Timer Script
![Logo](logo.png)

OBS Timer Script is an easy to use python script that provides a very basic graphical user interface which allows you to start a countdown timer.
It works by outputing the timer data to a text file which you can then quickly import into an OBS Text Source.

**Lastest update:** v1x
*Should be updated soon though (written on July 7th, 2019)*

**WARNING: For some reasons, the latest release doesn't seem to work anymore. A new release should be available soon though.**

# Quick start

Here is a quick guide to help you setup OBS Timer Script.

## Setup

 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Alexinfos/obs-timer-script/archive/master.zip) from GitHub.
 2. Unzip the downloaded zip file
 3. Open OBS and create a new `Text (GDI+)` source.
 4. Check the `Read from file` box.
 5. Launch the `timer.exe` file bundled in the download. *(If Windows Defender SmartScreen blocks the execution, just click `More infos` and `Run anyway` as Windows Defender is very annoying with non-signed software) (I promise I'll try to sign it next time)*

 6. **The end of this guide should come soon as I don't remember what the GUI looks like and I'm not able to run the software anymore...**
